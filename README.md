# Collaborative-Filtering-Recommender-system-
📖 Overview

This project implements a Hybrid Recommendation System for Amazon products using both Memory-Based and Model-Based Collaborative Filtering techniques.
It helps predict user preferences and recommend products based on past ratings and behavior.

🚀 Features

📊 Data preprocessing and cleaning of Amazon product reviews dataset

🧮 Collaborative Filtering (Memory-based: KNN, Model-based: SVD)

🧪 Performance evaluation using RMSE & MAE

🔮 Hybrid model combining multiple recommendation techniques

⚙️ Tech Stack

Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Frontend: React / Flask (for UI)

Deployment (optional): Streamlit, Vercel, or Heroku

📊 Dataset

Source: Amazon Product Reviews Dataset

Contains user-item interactions (ratings, reviews, product details).

Due to size, the dataset is not uploaded here. You can download from Amazon Review Data

📈 Results

SVD Model: Achieved RMSE ≈ 1.328 and MAE ≈ 1.053

KNN Model: RMSE ≈ 1.311 and MAE ≈ 1.030

Hybrid Model improved accuracy compared to individual methods


📌 Future Improvements

Add content-based filtering for hybrid recommendations

Deploy as a fully hosted web app with real-time user interaction

Integrate deep learning methods (Neural Collaborative Filtering, Autoencoders)
